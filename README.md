# Server-Client-SocketProgramming

It's simple code that a server returns the length of message from a client.
If you want to run, run Server.java, choose which port the progrom listens and what transport protocol you want.
Then, run Client.java and give a server name and a port number.
After that, you can type a message on the client. The response from the server will be displayed.
